<h1>Beyond POJOs: a desktop application framework based on "Generic Lightweight OBjectS"</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Globs is an application framework in which the model part uses generic objects based on a formal
  metamodel description. These generic objects offer two main advantages over traditional POJOs / Java Beans:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since all the model objects use the same Java class, it is very easy to build reusable code and components that
    work with any model entity.</li>
  <li>The meta-model (definition of types, fields and constraints on these fields) is accessible through a number of
    plain Java APIs that are much easier to deal with than the introspection APIs. This also makes it very easy
    to build reusable components.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this approach, we provide a number of generic services:</p>
<ul>
  <li>model-driven GUI components that keep themselves in sync with the underlying model objects</li>
  <li>transparent SQL mapping</li>
  <li>transparent XML mapping</li>
  <li>binary serialization for client/server exchanges</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Theoretically, this concept can be used for many kinds of applications. However, we are now strongly focused on
  the desktop application area.
</p>

<p>
  We have implemented various aspects of this approach in large business applications, our goal now is to build a
  comprehensive open source framework based on these concepts. This development is guided by real-world needs, since we
  are using it to build a commercial application.

<h2>Joining us</h2>

<p>We accept developers with some experience working on frameworks, metadata, and/or Swing. In any case
  having some experience with a test-intensive environment (such as an XP project) is a must.</p>
