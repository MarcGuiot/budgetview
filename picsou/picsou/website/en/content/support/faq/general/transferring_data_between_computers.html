            You can transfer your data from one computer to another, even if they use different
            operating systems (Mac/Windows/Linux).</p>

        <p>To do this, you need to <a href="/buy">purchase an activation code</a> first. You can then follow the steps
            below.</p>

        <p>On your first computer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Launch BudgetView and use the "Create backup file" function from the "File" menu</li>
            <li>Copy this backup file on an USB key, or send it to yourself by email</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On you new computer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Retrieve your backup file</li>
            <li>Install BudgetView</li>
            <li>Launch BudgetView</li>
            <li>Register your activation code (<a href="/support/faq/activation-code-registration">learn more</a>)</li>
            <li>Use the "Restore backup file" function from the "File" menu</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note: The BudgetView activation code lets you use the application on two computers.
            Please take care of not sharing your code with other people, or it could be deactivated.
