      The BudgetView activation code lets you use the application on two computers.
      Please take care of not sharing your code with other people, or it could be deactivated.

    <p>
      You can transfer your budget data from one computer to the next
      using the "Create backup" and "Restore backup" functions from the File menu.</p>
