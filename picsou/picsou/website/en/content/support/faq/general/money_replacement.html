            Microsoft Money was taken off the market in June 2009.
            If you are a Money user looking for a replacement, you can try <a href="/">BudgetView</a>,
            keeping in mind that BudgetView holds a philosophy based on two major principles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Working on the budget in its entirety, with a visual format, rather than monitoring elementary
              operations.</li>
            <li>Anticipating your budget over coming months so as to prepare and carry out projects (investments,
              travel, significant purchases etc.)</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Anticipating your budget over coming months so as to prepare and carry out projects (investments, travel,
      significant purchases etc.)</p>

    <p>Follow the instructions below to transfer your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Export data from Money</h2>

    <p>You will need to export your operations statements for each individual account, using the export option
      available in Money's "File" menu.</p>

    <p>This procedure works to create a QIF format file for the account you have selected. Be sure to make a note of the
      location where you have saved the file on your computer - the simplest thing is to save the files directly to your
      Windows desktop, so you can delete them later.</p>

    <h2>2. Import the QIF files in BudgetView</h2>

    <p>From within BudgetView, use the "File / Import transactions" menu. In the import dialog,
      you can select the generated QIF file and import it. During this operation,
      BudgetView will propose you to also import the corresponding categories.</p>

    <p>You need to start this export/import operation for every account you want to transfer.</p>

    <h2>3. Prepare your budget</h2>

    <p>When all your accounts are transferred, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/support/guides/categorization">Categorize the transactions</a> for which no envelope is set</li>
      <li><a href="/support/guides/budget">Finalise your budget</a></li>
    </ul>
