<p>BudgetView connects to the internet to verify your activation code, download new versions and collect information
    regarding use of the application. <b>None of your bank connection codes or financial or personal date will ever be
        passed on to us</b>. Information related to your bank accounts or budget remains on your own computer.
</p>

<h2>Initial connection</h2>

<p><img src="/files/images/support/faq.png" class="faq-icon"/>On launching, BudgetView connects to our servers to
    verify whether a new version is available and to ensure your activation key is still valid.</p>

<h2>Importing data</h2>

<p>There are two ways of <a href="/support/guides/import">importing transaction statements</a>
    from your bank’s website: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Usually, you will download a file yourself, by visiting your bank’s internet site using your browser and once
        the file is on your computer you import it into BudgetView. Using this method, BudgetView does not need to
        connect to the Internet.</li>
    <li>Should you bank offer a direct OFX download, like the French La Banque Postale, you enter your connection
        identification details into BudgetView so that it can connect to your bank’s servers. Using this method,
        BudgetView connects to the Internet to reach your bank’s servers and capture your bank statements. Remember that
        if you do not want to use this system, you are recommended to download your statements using method 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases, downloading of your statements from your bank’s site is protected by the system implemented by
    your bank – generally via a secured SSL connection such as those used by the vast majority of online
    retailers.</p>

<h2>Connection when you close the application</h2>

<p>The first two times you use the application, when you close it, BudgetView sends us anonymous information
    regarding how for you have progressed in utilizing the application. The information in question is a few yes/no
    indicators telling us whether you have successfully downloaded certain things, whether you have classified
    operations and whether you have reached the end of the initial assistant. These data are very useful to use to
    continue improving the initial use experience of the software.</p>
<p>Please note that the information in question is succinct and anonymous and regards only application utilization.
    No information is sent regarding your accounts, bank, transactions or budget.</p>
