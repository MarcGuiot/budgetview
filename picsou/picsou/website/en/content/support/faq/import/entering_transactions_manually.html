      We advise to enter transactions manually only if you have no means to download statements
      for a given account. If you want to declare future transactions for an account that supports statements downloads,
      you can simply set a planned amount for the corresponding envelope.</p>

    <p>To enter transactions, go to the "Categorization" view. At the bottom of the transactions
      list, you will see a "Enter transactions manually" button.</p>

    <p>You can also set your account balance manually by clicking on the corresponding amount
      in the "Accounts" view.</p>
