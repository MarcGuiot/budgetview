    First of all, you need to declare your savings accounts in BudgetView, either
    by importing the corresponding transfactions, or by creating them manually
    in the "Accounts" view.
</p>

<p>
    For each savings account, BudgetView creates two envelopes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>one envelope for transfers from your main accounts to this savings account</li>
    <li>one envelope for transfers from this savings account to your main accounts</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For instance, if your savings accounts is called "My savings", you will find
    two envelopes in the "Savings" block of the "Budget" view:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"From My savings"</li>
    <li>"To My savings"</li>
</ul>

<p>
    To categorize your transfer transactions, select the corresponding envelope in the
    "Savings" block of the "Categorization" view.</p>
