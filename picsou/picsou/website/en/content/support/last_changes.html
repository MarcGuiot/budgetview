    <h2>version 2.28 <span class="date">May 2, 2012</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can now carry over the remainder or the overdraw of an envelope over the next months.
        For instance, let's say that you spent only 100.00 out of 150.00 in leisures this month. Using this
        function, BudgetView will automatically carry the remaining 50.00 over the next month, setting the
        planned amount of this envelope to 200.00. To try this, click on the envelope name in the Budget
        view and select the "Carry ... over" menu option.
        </li>
      <li>BudgetView now better handles non-standard date formats in OFX files</li>
      <li>In the login screen, you can now select an user name among the list of existing
        user accounts.</li>
      <li>This version also includes a few additional bug fixes. For instance, BudgetView does not
        request incoming connections anymore, and we also fixed an error that occured in some
        specific cases when editing envelopes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>To upgrade BudgetView</b>, you just have to launch it, wait for a few seconds, and follow
      the instructions that will appear on the screen. If you don't have BudgetView yet,

    <h2>version 2.27 <span class="date">April 16, 2012</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can now better control how transactions are planned in the future, by forcing a given
        envelope to plan only one transaction per month, on a given day each month. This is useful for instance
        to tell BudgetView to plan your salary as a single transaction on the 29th of every month. To use
        this feature, click on the envelope name in the Budget view and go to the "Forecast" tab.</li>
      <li>You can now edit the labels of transactions, by right-clicking on them in the Categorization
        and Accounts views.</li>
      <li>When importing files or creating accounts, you can now add your own bank to the list.</li>
      <li>When entering a transaction, you can now select a month in the past, even if this month is
        not displayed in the time bar at the top of the screen.</li>
      <li>This version also includes a few bug fixes, for instance in some specific cases when importing
        CSV files.</li>
    </ul>
