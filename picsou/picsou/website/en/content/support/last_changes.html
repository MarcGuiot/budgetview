    <ul>
      <li>This version provides support for Java version 1.7, eliminating an error
        when downloading or categorizing transactions.</li>
      <li>Two additional fixes are also included - an error in the display of sub-envelopes

    <ul>
      <li>In the Analysis view, you can now see the details of sub-envelopes for a given envelope. To use
        this, click on an envelope that contains sub-envelopes in the corresponding repartition chart : you will see a
        "Show sub-envelopes" button appear just below the chart.</li>
      <li>This version also includes a few additional bug fixes, for example when importing OFX or CSV files,
        using the OFX direct download option with some banks, or in the display of envelopes related to
        projects in the Budget view.</li>
    </ul>

    <!------------------------------>

    <h2>version 2.28 <span class="date">May 2, 2012</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can now carry over the remainder or the overdraw of an envelope over the next months.
        For instance, let's say that you spent only 100.00 out of 150.00 in leisures this month. Using this
        function, BudgetView will automatically carry the remaining 50.00 over the next month, setting the
        planned amount of this envelope to 200.00. To try this, click on the envelope name in the Budget
        view and select the "Carry ... over" menu option.
      </li>

        specific cases when editing envelopes.</li>
    </ul>

    <!------------------------------>

    <h2>version 2.27 <span class="date">April 16, 2012</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can now better control how transactions are planned in the future, by forcing a given
        envelope to plan only one transaction per month, on a given day each month. This is useful for instance
        to tell BudgetView to plan your salary as a single transaction on the 29th of every month. To use
        this feature, click on the envelope name in the Budget view and go to the "Forecast" tab.</li>
      <li>You can now edit the labels of transactions, by right-clicking on them in the Categorization
        and Accounts views.</li>

      <li>This version also includes a few bug fixes, for instance in some specific cases when importing
        CSV files.</li>

      <li>Two new options are available in the preferences dialog available from the "Files / Preferences" menu:</li>

        <li>Change the color theme of the application</li>
      </ul>
      <li>When using the application for the first time, you now have the ability to see
        BudgetView at work on a demo account.</li>
      <li>The version provides a few bug fixes - for instance an error occuring when deleting an operation
        in some cases.</li>
