    <h2>version 4.02 <span class="date">august 31, 2015</span></h2>

    <p>For this version we have mainly worked on simplifying the initial setup for newcomers.
        We have improved the onboarding wizard and also revisited the organization
        of the envelope edition dialog:</p>

             alt="New envelope edition dialog to configure the forecast"/>
    </div>

    <p>In terms of new features, users of the "Analysis" add-on will find a new view: the evolution of the envelopes.
        This view lets you observe the evolution of each of your envelopes over time, up to the last three years.</p>

             alt="Analysis add-on: new 'Evolution' view"/>
    </div>

    <p>Some of you were requesting a longer timespan for the forecasts.
        We have increased the maximum to 60 months, which you can set in the Preferences panel.</p>

    <p>We also added some color schemes. You can change the theme in the File / Preferences menu.</p>

    <!------------------------------>

    <h2>version 4.01 <span class="date">may 9, 2015</span></h2>

    <p>This version integrates a few fixes, and clarifies the fact that BudgetView is now a free application that
        can be optionally extended with paid add-ons.</p>

    <!------------------------------>

    <h2>version 4.0 <span class="date">april 19, 2015</span></h2>


    <h3>A whole new interface</h3>

    <p>In the last months, we have redesigned the entire interface to simplify
        two things: the discovery of the application by new users and the management of multiple bank accounts.
        We are now pleased to present a brand new look&amp;feel for your application:</p>

    <div class="centered-image">
        <img src="/files/images_en/support/versions/v4_0/new_interface.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>The main changes are detailed below.</p>

    <h3>A "weather forecast" for your bank accounts</h3>

    <p>Managing a budget is first and foremost about answering one question: "Is there a risk of overdraw in the near
        future?"</p>

    <p>BudgetView 4.0 answers this question directly:</p>

    <div class="centered-image">
        <img src="/files/images_en/support/versions/v4_0/personal_budget_forecast.png" alt="Personal budget forecast"/>
    </div>

    <p>Forecasts are available on each of your accounts: a cloudy or rainy weather indicates a risk of overdraw by the
        end of next month..</p>

    <h3>Account filtering</h3>

    <p>The Dashboard, Budget and Account views now use the same left-hand sidebar with an overview of all your
        accounts:</p>

    <div class="centered-image">
        <img src="/files/images_en/support/versions/v4_0/account_filtering.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>You can hide or show the graph of the evolution of the balance of each account, and also select an account to
        see only the relevant information in the rest of the view. With this new logic, you can easily monitor each
        individual account.</p>

    <p>With these changes, the specific Savings Accounts view has disappeared: savings accounts are now
        represented in exactly the same manner as current accounts.</p>


    <h3>A more flexible management of multiple accounts</h3>

    <p>Since the origins of BudgetView, the calculation of the forecast was made ​​for all current accounts as a
        whole - it was not possible to follow the evolution of a specific current account.</p>

    <p>In the 3.14 release, we have allowed to follow each account individually by associating each envelope
        to a given account. However, this solution was too restrictive for some of our users, forcing some of
        them to duplicating several envelopes.</p>

    <p>Version 4.0 corrects this by offering a much more flexible approach: envelopes are now by default
        related to all current accounts, and the projection into the future is based for each account on the
        behavior observed in the two last months.</p>

    <div class="centered-image">
        <img src="/files/images_en/support/versions/v4_0/multi_account_envelopes.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>Thus, if you only use one of your accounts to your envelope Leisure , the provisional calculation will take
        into account that rate. If you have completed one third of expenditures on an account, and two thirds on
        another, this same distribution will apply in the forecast.</p>

    <p>In cases where you feel it necessary , you can always edit any envelope and specify that it applies only to a
        given account. The projections will then be made exclusively on the account, and the envelope will not be
        visible in the Categorization view when you select an operation of this account.</p>

    <h3>Transfers</h3>

    <p>We have changed the way to represent transfers between your accounts. Now, the "Savings" block in the Budget view
        becomes "Transfers" and welcomes all your transfers: transfers to or from your savings accounts,
        but also transfers between your current accounts.</p>

    <h3>A base version that becomes... FREE!</h3>

    <p>To share the best budget forecasts with a larger number of users, we make the heart BudgetView 4.0 free.
        Some features become paid add-ons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating <b>envelope groups</b> in the Budget view</li>
        <li>Managing <b>projects</b></li>
        <li>The whole <b>analysis</b> view</li>
        <li>the visualisation of your budget on the <b>Android app</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These add-ons are presented in a new dedicated view:</p>

    <div class="centered-image">
        <img src="/files/images_en/support/versions/v4_0/addons.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>If you had bought a BudgetView activation code for earlier versions, it remains of course valid and
        automatically activates all available add-ons.</p>

            For instance, let's say that you spent only 100.00 out of 150.00 in leisures this month. Using this
            function, BudgetView will automatically carry the remaining 50.00 over the next month, setting the
            planned amount of this envelope to 200.00. To try this, click on the envelope name in the Budget
            view and select the "Carry ... over" menu option.

            request incoming connections anymore, and we also fixed an error that occured in some
            specific cases when editing envelopes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!------------------------------>

    <h2>version 2.27 <span class="date">April 16, 2012</span></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can now better control how transactions are planned in the future, by forcing a given
            envelope to plan only one transaction per month, on a given day each month. This is useful for instance
            to tell BudgetView to plan your salary as a single transaction on the 29th of every month. To use
            this feature, click on the envelope name in the Budget view and go to the "Forecast" tab.
        </li>
        <li>You can now edit the labels of transactions, by right-clicking on them in the Categorization
            and Accounts views.

            program such as Excel or Numbers. For more information, please read the
            <a href="/support/faq/import-csv">CSV import guide</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Two new options are available in the preferences dialog available from the "Files / Preferences" menu:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Change the date format (for instance "March 13, 2012" instead of "13 March 2012")</li>
            <li>Change the color theme of the application</li>
