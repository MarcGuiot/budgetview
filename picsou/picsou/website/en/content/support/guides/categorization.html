      Once you have imported your operations, you need to divide them into various "envelopes" so as to organize your
      budget. Follow the guide below to find out more.
    </p>

    <h2>Envelopes</h2>

    <p>An envelope contains a set of logically related operations. For example, your vehicle’s various credit expiry dates are all attached to a "Car Credit" envelope representing this credit.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Most envelopes refer to a single operation repeated at regular intervals – for example a "Landline Phone" envelope repeated every month or an "Electricity" envelope repeated every two months.</p>

    <table class="calendar">
      <tr class="months">
        <td class="name"></td>
        <td>Jan</td>
        <td>Feb</td>
        <td>Mar</td>
        <td>Apr</td>
        <td>May</td>
        <td>June</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="values">
        <td class="name">Car loan</td>
        <td>357.70</td>
        <td>357.70</td>
        <td>357.70</td>
        <td>357.70</td>
        <td>357.70</td>
        <td>357.70</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="values">
        <td class="name">Electricity</td>
        <td>55.80</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>55.80</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>55.80</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Other envelopes group together several operations carried out over the course of a single month – for example a "Shopping" envelope containing all of the purchases made during that month, from various retailers, that you want to be able to view as a global expenses envelope.</p>


    <h2>Creating envelopes</h2>


    <p>BudgetView offers you default options of the most commonly used envelopes for family budgets. You can delete or rename these envelopes, as well as creating your own.</p>

    <h2>Categorization</h2>

    <p>You categorize your operations under the "categorization" section, represented by this icon:</p>

    <div class="centered">
      <img src="http://www.mybudgetview.com/files/images/views/categorization.png" alt="Categorization view" width="31"
           height="24"/>
    </div>

    <p>In this view, BudgetView shows you all of the operations in need of categorization.
      You need to select operations and then assign them to envelopes under six different budget items.</p>

    <p>Certain envelopes have been created by the envelope creation assistant. During this categorization phase, you will no doubt have to create new ones so as to define your budget more precisely.</p>


    <h2>Budget areas</h2>

    <p>BudgetView organize envelopes into 5 different budget items:</p>

    <table class="field-value" style="width: 80%">
      <tr>
        <td class="field">
          Income
        </td>
        <td class="value">
          <p>This area contains all of your sources of income, regular or otherwise. The most common types of income are salaries, self-employed income and royalties as well as any returns on investment.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="field">
          Fixed expenses
        </td>
        <td class="value">
          <p>This area contains operations repeated on a regular basis – every month, every six months, every year etc. The most common fixed charges are rental payments, credit fees, subscriptions, taxes, insurance. Purchases divided into installments can also be considered fixed charges.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="field">
          Variable expenses
        </td>
        <td class="value">
          <p>This area contains on-going expenses organized into general envelopes such as shopping, healthcare, clothing and leisure. A number of operations are assigned to these envelopes every month. You can define and monitor the total amount assigned to each of your envelopes every month.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="field">
          Savings
        </td>
        <td class="value">
          <p>This area contains the various withdrawals and payments made to your savings accounts.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="field">
          "Extras"
        </td>
        <td class="value">
          <p>This area contains one-off operations for the month – significant purchases, travel, one-off repairs etc. You can use this item to make advance predictions regarding your projects - typically, you create an envelope entitled "TV purchase" or "weekend in Etretat" in a coming month, so as to review the relevant expenses and their effect on your budget in advance.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Once you have categorized your operations, you can refer to the Budget section to view all of you envelopes under each budget item.</p>
