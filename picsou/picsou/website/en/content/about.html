              BudgetView makes personal budgeting as quick and easy as possible to help you not only get a clear
              picture of your finances, but to realize your most important financial goals as well.

            <td class="left">Why?</td>
            <td class="right">
              Because there is no reason why budgeting your finances should be such a pain, and because money alone
              should not prevent people from fulfilling the goals they really care about.

              It all started in may 2006, with a small group of program users.
              BudgetView grew step by step, evolving and improving over time, until it took its current shape.
              The company was created in October 2010, and the
              product was made available to the public in November 2010.
