          If you do like most of our friends, you just have a look from time to time
          to you bank reports to avoid overdraws and check that no suspect transaction appears on
          your accounts.</p>
        <p>
          We both followed this approach for years, until we realized its limits: months
          were passing by, and despite a few salary increases we were ending up each month with nothing
          left on our accounts. As a result, we couldn't realize a few projects that were important
          for us: buying a house, going on trips, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Where was our money going?</b> It was very difficult for us to know.</p>
        <p>
          To tell the truth, managing one's accounts has never been funny. How can one see anything in the
          long listings of transactions the banks sends us every months, or those displayed on its website?
          And it's not really better with most money management software, still based on the same long lists of
          transactions.</p>

          A few years ago, we realized that if we could have a clear picture of our budget, and if we could
          anticipate its evolution in the following weeks or months, we could
          <b>master our spending instead of just suffering its consequences</b>.</p>

        <p>We thus started two complementary experiments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We started designing and developing the BudgetView application to get a clear vision
            of our budget with the less tedious manipulations.</li>
          <li>We started reading books, browsing articles and talking with people around us, looking for
            for the main principles of personal finance management.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here is what we learned:</p>

  <h2>Start from the vision: your project</h2>

  <div class="why-block">

    <table id="projects">
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <p>
            Why would you accept additional constraints in your spending, if it's not to reach a goal that is
            really important for you?</p>
          <p><b>Think about your own projects.</b> What would you like to do? Go on a trip to the end of the world?
            Install a jacuzzi in your basement? Buy the latest home cinema installation?
            Reinforce your savings to be able to face any unexpected situation in the future? Prepare for retirement?
            Save for your daughter's college?
          </p>
          <p>Take time to think about it seriously, to talk about it with your spouse - after all, why spend time
            managing your budget if you have no goal?</p>

  <h2>State your project clearly</h2>

  <div id="project-definition" class="why-block">

    <p>
      From a budgeting point of view, you should be able to define your project as follows:</p>
    <div id="project-definition-intro" class="project-definition">
      <p>“In ___ months, I need _____ to ___________________________” </p>
    </div>
    <p>Then, by dividing the expected amount by the number of months, you will get the amount you need
      to save each month to reach your goal.</p>
    <p>Here are a few examples:</p>

    <table id="project-definition-examples">
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <p>“In 18 months, I need 3600$ for my trip across Argentina.”</p>
        </td>
        <td class="right">
          <p>200$/month</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <p>“In 6 months, I need 900$ to replace the old furniture in my kitchen."</p>
        </td>
        <td class="right">
          <p>150$/month</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <p>“In 12 months, I need 1000$ in my savings accounts to be able to face any unexpected event.”</p>
        </td>
        <td class="right">
          <p>85$/month</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>What is your own project?</p>
    <div id="project-definition-try">

    </div>

  <h2>Pay yourself first!</h2>

  <div class="why-block">

    <table id="savings">
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <img src="/files/images/why/savings.png" alt="Vos projets" width="260" height="195"/>
        </td>
        <td class="right">
          <p>
            The most efficient way for you to reach your goals is then to ask your bank to
            <b>transfer this amount automatically at the beginning of each month</b>. If you don't
            have already one, we recommend that you open a savings account to do this.</p>
          <p>
            Putting you money in a "safe place" like this will help you fight the temptation to spend it! You can
            then start managing your budget more precisely.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <h2>Master your budget</h2>

  <div id="budget" class="why-block">

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <p>
            The main consequence of this automatic transfer is that <b>your budget is now a little tighter</b>.
            You now have to monitor it a little closer to avoid any overdraw at the end of the month.</p>
          <p>
            This is where BudgetView shines. To avoid being in the red, you define at the beginning of
            the month the  revenue and spendings <i>envelopes</i> that constitute your budget:
            salary, groceries, leisures, etc.</p>
          <p>
            You then set the planned amounts for your envelopes so that the balance of your accounts never
            become negative in the estimation computed by the application:</p>
          <div class="centered" style="margin-top: 10px;">
            <img src="/files/images/why/arrow_down.png" alt="Continuer" width="71" height="23"/>
          </div>
        </td>
        <td class="right">
          <img src="/files/images/why/BudgetView.png" alt="BudgetView"/>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="centered">
      <img src="/files/images/why/reglage_budget.png" alt="Réglage de votre budget"/>
    </div>

    <p>
      After that, you check every week that your budget is in line with your plan. In case of an overrun on an
      envelope, you can adjust other envelopes to avoid any overdraw - without compromising the money you set
      aside for your project.</p>
    <p>
      After a few weeks, when you are comfortable with the monitoring of your budget, you can start
      working on your budget for the next few months to anticipate the evolution of your finances.</p>

    <p>Voilà! You are now on track to realize your projects!</p>
