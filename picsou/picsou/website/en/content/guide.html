          If you're like us and most of our friends, you glance at your bank accounts rarely and then only to check for
          suspicious transactions or to avoid overdrawing funds.</p>
        <p>
          For years, both of us followed this approach before discovering its limits: as the months passed, and despite
          salary increases, we ended up with nothing left in our accounts at the end of each month. As a result, we
          couldn't achieve those goals that were important to us: buying a house, going on trips, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Where was our money going?</b> It was very difficult to know for certain.</p>
        <p>
          To tell the truth, managing financial accounts has never been fun or even easy. It's difficult to make sense
          out of any pattern in the long transaction statements that the bank sends out every few months or displays on
          its website. Most money management software is no better since it is still based on the same tedious
          lists.</p>

          A few years ago, we discovered a solution to this problem: a clear picture of our budget and the anticipation
          of how it would unfold in the coming weeks and months would allow us to
          <b>master our spending instead of just suffering its consequences</b>.</p>

        <p>To fulfill this, we started two complementary experiments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We began to design and develop the BudgetView application, which would allow us to have a clear vision of
            our budget without the tedious management of long lists of financial operations.</li>
          <li>We read books, browsed articles, and talked to those around us to find the main principles of personal
            financial management.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here is what we learned:</p>

            If you're not trying to reach a specific goal that is important to you, why accept more restrictions on your
            spending than you need?</p>
          <p><b>Think about your own projects.</b> What would you like to do? Maybe you'd like to go on a trip to the
            end of the world? Perhaps you want to enjoy comfort at home by installing a jacuzzi in your basement or
            buying the latest home cinema installation. Or maybe you want to save your hard-earned money so that you can
            face any unexpected situations in the future, prepare for retirement, or pay for your daughter's college
            education.
          </p>
          <p>Take the time to think about it seriously and to talk it over with your spouse. After all, why spend time
            managing your budget if you have no goal?</p>

  <h2>State your goals clearly</h2>

  <div id="project-definition" class="why-block">

    <p>
      From a budgeting point of view, you should be able to define your goal as follows:</p>
    <div id="project-definition-intro" class="project-definition">
      <p>“In ___ months, I need _____ to ___________________________” </p>
    </div>
    <p>Using this formula, divide the desired funds by the number of months you have planned. The result is the amount
      of money you need to save each month in order to reach that goal.</p>
    
    <p>Here are a few examples:</p>

    <table id="project-definition-examples">
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <p>“In 18 months, I need 3600$ for my trip across Argentina.”</p>
        </td>
        <td class="right">
          <p>200$/month</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <p>“In 6 months, I need 900$ to replace the old furniture in my kitchen."</p>
        </td>
        <td class="right">
          <p>150$/month</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <p>“In 12 months, I need 1000$ in savings to be able to face any unexpected event.”</p>
        </td>
        <td class="right">
          <p>85$/month</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>What are your ideal goals?</p>

  <h2>Pay yourself first!</h2>

  <div class="why-block">

    <table id="savings">
      <tr>
        <td class="left">

            After you have calculated the monthly sum needed to achieve your goal, the most efficient way to save the
            money is to ask your bank to <b>automatically transfer that amount to your savings at the beginning of each
            month</b>. We recommend that you open a savings account if you don't already have one.</p>
          <p>
            Putting your money in a "safe place" like this will help you fight the temptation to spend it! You can then
            start managing your budget more accurately and efficiently.</p>

      </tr>

  <h2>Master your budget</h2>

  <div id="budget" class="why-block">

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td class="left">
          <p>
            The main consequence of this automatic transfer is that <b>your budget will now be a little tighter</b>. You
            will have to monitor it even closer to avoid any overdrafts at the end of the month.</p>
          <p>
            This is where BudgetView shines. To avoid being in the red, you start each month by setting up the
            <i>envelopes</i> that will track the revenue and spending of your budget: salary, groceries, leisure, etc.</p>
          <p>
            You then set planned amounts for each envelope so that the balance of your accounts never becomes negative
            when the application computes your estimated budget:</p>
          <div class="centered" style="margin-top: 10px;">
            <img src="/files/images/why/arrow_down.png" alt="Continuer" width="71" height="23"/>
          </div>
        </td>
        <td class="right">
          <img src="/files/images/why/BudgetView.png" alt="BudgetView"/>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="centered">
      <img src="/files/images/why/reglage_budget.png" alt="Réglage de votre budget"/>
    </div>

    <p>
      After setting up the envelopes, you will need to check at least once a week that your budget stays in line with
      your plans. If you encounter a cost overrun in one envelope, you can adjust the amounts in other envelopes to
      avoid any overdraw. This allows you to stay within budget without compromising the money you have set aside for
      your goals.</p>
    <p>
      After a few weeks, when you have become comfortable with the process of monitoring your budget, you can then begin
      planning for the next few months to allow the program to project the evolution of your finances.</p>

    <p>Voilà! You are now on track to realize your projects!</p>
