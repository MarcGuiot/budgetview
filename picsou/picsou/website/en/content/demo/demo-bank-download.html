    <p>You will find here instructions to download a sample OFX file to try out BudgetView:</p>

    <p>If BudgetView is properly installed, you can then import this sample file as follows, depending
      on which browser you use:</p>

    <h2>Firefox</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Click on this link: <a href="/files/demo.ofx">demo.ofx</a></li>
      <li>Select the "Save File" option</li>
      <li>In the "Downloads" window, double click on the "demo.ofx" file
        (you can open this window from the "Tools/Downloads" menu if needed).</li>
      <li>This should start BudgetView automatically. If BudgetView does not appear, 
        select it in your task bar.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Safari</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Click on this link: <a href="/files/demo.ofx">demo.ofx</a></li>
      <li>In the "Downloads" window, double click on the "demo.ofx" file
        (you can open this window from the "Window/Downloads" menu if needed).</li>
      <li>This should start BudgetView automatically.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Chrome</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Click on this link: <a href="/files/demo.ofx">demo.ofx</a></li>
      <li>The downloaded file should appear at the bottom of the window.</li>
      <li>Click on the file at the bottom of the window, that will open BudgetView automatically.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

    <p>If double clicking on the file does not open BudgetView, you can right-click on the
      file in your browser "Downloads" window and select "Show in finder" to locate the file.
      You can then right click on the file, use "Open with..." and find BudgetView.</p>
