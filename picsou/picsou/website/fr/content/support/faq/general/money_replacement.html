            Microsoft Money has been discontinued on June 2009.
            If you are a Money user and are looking for a replacement, you can give BudgetView
            a try, keeping in mind however that the BudgetView approach is based on
            two main drivers:</p>
          <ul>
            <il>Work on your whole budget visually, instead of managing lists of
              individual transactions.
            </il>
            <li>Forecast the evolution of your budget for the upcoming months, to
              prepare and realize your most important projects
              (trips, major purchases, investments, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>BudgetView allows you to retrieve your financial statements from Microsoft Money,
      along with the corresponding categories, using the steps below:</p>

    <h2>1. Export data from Money</h2>

    <p>You need to export your statements account per account, by following the following steps:</p>

    <div class="centered">
      <img src="/files/images/support/faq/money_export.png" alt="Exporting Microsoft Money data"/>
    </div>

    <p>This will create a QIF file for the account that you selected. Make sure to note the
      place where you saved this file on your computer - a simple way to do that is to put it on
      your Windows Desktop.</p>

    <h2>2. Import the QIF file in BudgetView</h2>

    <p>In BudgetView, you can then import this file as follows:</p>

    <div class="centered">
      <img src="/files/images/support/faq/money_import.png" alt="Importing a Microsoft Money file in BudgetView"/>
    </div>

    <p>When importing these operations, BudgetView will propose you to also import the corresponding
      categories.</p>

    <p>You need to restart this import/export operation for every account you want to retrieve
      from Money.</p>

    <h2>3. Prepare your budget</h2>

    <p>Once you have retrieved your main accounts, you will have to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/support/guides/categorization">Categorize the remaining transactions</a></li>
      <li><a href="/support/guides/budget">Complete your budget</a></li>
    </ul>
