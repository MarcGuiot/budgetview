<p>
  It sometimes happens that a transaction arrives on your bank account just before the first day
  or just after the last day of the month where you had planned it in your budget.</p>

<p>
  For instance, the salary that you expected on the 28th of January
  is transferred on your account on February, 2. This creates an imbalance in your budget,
  with no salary in January and two in February.</p>

<p>
  To manage this kind of cases, you can <i>shift</i> the corresponding transaction to the next month.</p>

<p>
  In the <a href="card_categorization">Categorization</a> view,
  select that transaction in the left-hand list. On the right you should see a "Shift" button
  if this transaction is placed before the 10th or after the 20th of the month.</p>

<p>The shift function works as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the transaction is before the 10th of the month, it will be moved to the last day of the previous month.</li>
  <li>If the transaction is after the 20th of the month, it will be moved to the first day of the next month.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can cancel this shift by selecting the transaction again and using the "Unshift" button.</p>

<p>
  We recommend that you use this function only for exceptional cases, given the fact that the more
  you use it the more remote your budget will be from the reality of your bank accounts.</p>
