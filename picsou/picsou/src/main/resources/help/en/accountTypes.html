<p>BudgetView manages four different types of accounts:</p>

<h2>Main accounts</h2>

<p>These are typically the checking accounts with which you manage your day to day transactions.</p>
<p>You can categorize transactions from this accounts in all budget areas: income, recurring, variable, etc.</p>


<h2>Savings accounts</h2>

<p>You use these accounts to put money aside, either on a short term or long term basis. These
can be normal savings accounts or mutual funds.</p>
<p>Transactions from savings accounts can only be categorized in the Savings budget area. If you
  use one such account to make frequent transactions in your day to day budget (groceries, leisures, etc.),
  you should consider making it a Main Account.</p>


<h2>Credit card accounts</h2>

<p>These accounts are specific kinds of revolving accounts, which grant a line of credit to the card
  holder and level the spendings in monthly payments.
  These accounts are managed as main accounts for the moment in BudgetView.</p>


<h2>Deferred debit card accounts</h2>

<p>With these debit cards:</p>
<ul>
  <li>transactions are managed on a dedicated account</li>
  <li>once a month, the position of this dedicated amount is reset to zero, and an transaction
    is issued on the customer's main account to cover all the expenses made on the credit card
    during the last period.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the <a href="help:deferredCards">deferred debit cards</a> page for further details.</p>
