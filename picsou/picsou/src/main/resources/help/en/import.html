<p>BudgetView uses the electronic transaction listings made available from your bank.</p>

<p>Note: if your bank does not allow downloading these listings, you can
  still <a href="help:manualInput">create transactions manually</a>.</p>

<p>To download your transactions, please follow the steps below:</p>

<h2>1. Connect to you bank website</h2>

<p>
  Select your bank in the import dialog. If your bank supports direct electronic downloads (without
  having to manually download files from their website), BudgetView will propose you
  to enter your connection identifiers and it will then proceed with the direct download. In this case,
  you will just have to follow the instructions that will appear on the screen.</p>

<p>If your bank does not propose a direct download, you have to go to your bank's website
  and follow the instructions below.</p>

<p>Note: If your bank does not appear in the banks list,
  you can in any case go to your bank's website on your own. The import will work properly, provided
  that your bank proposes to download statements as OFX or QIF files.</p>

<p>Once on your bank's website, you can login by entering you online identifier and password,
  and then navigate to the downloads page.</p>

<h2>2. Prepare the download</h2>

<p>Use the instructions below for the download:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Format</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>BudgetView recognizes the two main file formats used today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>OFX</b>: This is the format used by applications such as Microsoft Money.
          <b>We recommend that you use this format</b>, which contains account and position
          information.</li>
        <li><b>QIF</b>: This is the format used for instance by Intuit's Quicken.
          You should only use it if OFX is not available, because it usually does not contain
          information about accounts or account positions.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Period</b></td>
    <td valign="top">
      <p>
        You can download transactions for the past two or three months, without taking care of
        specific import dates - BudgetView will take care of excluding duplicate
        transactions automatically.</p>
      <p>
        To start building a realistic budget, <b>one or two months of data should be enough</b> -
        you will tune your budget later.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Date formats</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>
      In most cases BudgetView will recognize automatically the date format used in the file - there
      should be no need for you to select a specific format for the download.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Accounts</b></td>
    <td valign="top">
      <p>To start creating your budget, we recommend getting your <b>checking accounts</b> first.
        You can retrieve your other accounts later.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>3. Start downloading</h2>

<p>
  If during the download your browser proposes an "<b>Open with...</b>" option, we recommend that you use it:
  the downloaded file will be automatically opened in BudgetView.</p>
