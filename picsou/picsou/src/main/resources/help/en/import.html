<p>BudgetView uses the electronic transaction listings made available from your bank.</p>

<p>When you select your bank in the Import dialog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your bank supports it, BudgetView will propose to enter your identification information, and then
    download your transactions automatically.</li>
  
  <li>In other cases, you have to go to your bank's website to
    <a href="help:manualDownload">download your transactions manually</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your bank does not allow downloading these listings, you can
  still <a href="help:manualInput">create transactions manually</a>.</p>
