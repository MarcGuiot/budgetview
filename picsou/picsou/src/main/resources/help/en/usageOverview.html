<p>To get the most out of BudgetView, you first have to initialize your budget properly.</p>

<p>To do this, you first <a href="help:import">download</a> your financial data from your
  bank's website.
  Based on these downloaded transactions, you define and adjust the various
  <a href="help:envelopes">envelopes</a> that define your budget, in five different budget areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your <b>income</b>,</li>
  <li>your <b>fixed expenses</b> (loans, rent, subscriptions, etc.),</li>
  <li>your <b>variable expenses</b> (groceries, health, clothing, leisures, etc.),</li>
  <li>your <b>savings</b> operations,</li>
  <li>your <b>extras</b> (trips, projects, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For each envelope, you define how it repeats over time (for instance every month, every two months,
  every year), and you also provide the planned amounts for the current month.</p>

<p>Once most of your envelopes are properly defined, BudgetView provides you with an overall vision
  of your budget. At this stage, you can already monitor your budget month per month, by updating
  your financial statements every week.</p>

<p>
  The next step is then to use BudgetView to anticipate your budget for the incoming months.
  You will need to finish <a href="help:tuning">fine-tuning your budget</a> to get an accurate
  picture of the evolution of your finances. You will then be able to <a href="help:projects">create
  your projects</a> for the next few months: trips, important purchases, etc.</p>

<p>
  If you have not yet imported your transactions, we recommend that you start
  <a href="help:import">downloading</a> them now. Happy budgeting!</p>
