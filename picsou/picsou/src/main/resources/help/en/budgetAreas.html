<p>BudgetView organizes your budget in five areas:</p>

<h2>Income</h2>
<p>This area covers all your income sources, recurring or not.</p>
<p>The most frequent types of income are salaries, revenue from freelance work, author fees, and also revenue from
  investments.</p>\

<h2>Recurring expenses</h2>
<p>You will find in this area all expenditures that occur periodically - every month, every two or six months, or
  every year.</p>
<p>The most common kinds of recurring expenses are subscriptions, rent, loans, etc.</p>\

<h2>Variable expenses</h2>
<p>Variable expenses change from one month to the other depending on your consumption. Most of the time
  a variable expenses envelope will have several transactions in a given month, whereas a recurring expenses
  envelope will have only one.</p>
<p>The most common examples of variable expenses are groceries, leisures, health, clothing, etc.</p>

<h2>Savings</h2>
<p>This area covers all the transactions made on your savings accounts.</p>

<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>You use the "Extras" area for exceptional transactions - important purchases, holidays and trips,
  unexpected expenditures, etc.</p>
<p>Your <a href="help:projects">projects</a> appear as "Extras" envelopes.</p>
