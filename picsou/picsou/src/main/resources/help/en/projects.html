<p>In the <a href="help:card_home">Dashboard</a> view, BudgetView lets you create and
  manage your projects.</p>

<p>You can create projects for many kinds of events:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a trip,</li>
  <li>a wedding,</li>
  <li>home renovation activities,</li>
  <li>the birth of a baby,</li>
  <li>an important purchase,</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When creating your project, you provide the list of purchases that will be associated
  to it. For instance, when planning a trip you will enter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the booking for the accomodation,</li>
  <li>the purchase of equipement (clothes, photography, etc.),</li>
  <li>the outward journey,</li>
  <li>the accomodation,</li>
  <li>food,</li>
  <li>visits,</li>
  <li>local transportation,</li>
  <li>the return trip,</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>BudgetView then creates automatically an envelope for this project, with the same name
  as the project, in the "Extras" budget area. You can thus monitor the expected/actual amounts
  for the envelope in the "Extras" block of the Budget view, and also assign transactions
  to this envelope in the "Extras" block of the Categorization view.</p>
