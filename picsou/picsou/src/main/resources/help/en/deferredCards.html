<p>In the case of deferred debit cards:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the transactions made with this card are managed on a dedicated account</li>
  <li>once a month, the position of this dedicated account is reset to zero, and a withdrawal transaction
    appears on your main account, representing the total of the transactions made with the card during that period.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This monthly operation on your main account is a potential duplicate of all the transactions already
  made on your card account. To prevent it from introducing errors in your budget, you have
  to categorize it in a specific way.
</p>

<p>
  For this, you must first make sure that the card account is properly declared as a "Deferred debit card"
  account. To check this, you can click on the corresponding account in the <a href="help:card_data">Accounts</a>
  view.</p>

<p>
  After that, in the <a href="help:card_categorization">Categorization</a> view, when you select this monthly
  transaction, you need to select the budget area "Other". You should then find further instructions
  in the "Transfer to a deferred debit card account" section.</p>
