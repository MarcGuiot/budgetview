<p>
  It happens sometimes that a same transaction groups several expenses that you would like to
  categorize in different envelopes.</p>

<p>
  For instance, imagine that during your last visit to the shopping mall
  you bought 100$ worth of clothes, among other things, for a total of 250$.
  When updating your budget, you want to split the 250$ transaction as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>100$ for the "Clothing" envelope</li>
  <li>150$ for the "Groceries" envelope</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, you must first select the initial 250$ transaction in the Categorization view
  (<a href="card:categorization">select this view</a>), and then use the "Split" button on the right.
  A dialog will open, where you can enter an amount and a note for the transaction that you want to
  "extract" from the initial transaction. In our example, you can set an amount of 100 and for the
  note something like "holiday clothes".</p>

<p>
  When you validate this split, a new transaction appears in the list of transactions to categorize. The amount of
  the initial transaction has been reduced by the amount of the new one, leaving 150$ in this case.
  You can then select the new transaction and assign it to your "Clothing" envelope.</p>

<p>
  When you select one of the splitted transactions, all transactions related to the same initial transaction
  are highlighted. You can change the split by clicking on the "Change split..." button on the right hand panel.</p>
