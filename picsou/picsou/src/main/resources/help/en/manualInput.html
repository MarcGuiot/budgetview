<p>
  In cases where you cannot <a href="help:import">download your transactions</a>
  from your bank's website, you can enter your transactions manually in BudgetView.
  This can also be useful to manage a "cash" account.
 </p>

<p>To do this, you have to go to the <b>Categorization</b> view
  (<a href="card:categorization">select</a>). You will find there an "Enter transactions manually" button,
  at the bottom of the left-hand block.</p>

<p>Before entering your own transactions, you have to create an account whose update mode is
  "Manual input". If you don't have one, BudgetView will propose you to create it.</p>
