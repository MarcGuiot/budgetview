  In order to get reliable estimates for your budget, you have to tune properly
  all the envelopes that constitute your budget.</p>

<p>Please follow the steps below to finalize your budget.</p>

<h2>Categorize all your transactions</h2>

<p>Make sure that most of the transactions you have imported are categorized.</p>


<h2>Adjust your envelopes</h2>

<p>
  Make sure that envelopes are present for all the expenses you have planned for the next few weeks
  and months. You also need to set the proper periodicity for envelopes that you use every few
  months or every year.</p>

<p>Here is a list of envelopes that frequently require some tuning:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Birthdays</b> for all your family and friends, which repeat... every year.</li>
  <li><b>Car maintenance</b>, which needs usually to be done once a year.</li>
  <li><b>Gas and electricity bills</b>, which repeat every few months.</li>
  <li><b>Taxes</b>, in the case where you don't have monthly payments.</li>
  <li>Some <b>insurances</b>, par exemple your home insurance, which may be paid once per year.</li>
  <li><b>Christmas</b> presents</li>
  <li><b>Irregular income</b> such as bonuses, etc.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Adjust you "Miscellaneous" envelope</h2>

<p>You can use such an envelope to leave a "margin" amount for unanticipated expenses in your budget,
  and reduce it during the month when unanticipated expenses actually show up.</p>


<h2>Import your savings accounts</h2>

<p>
  Make sure that you have declared and imported all your savings accounts in BudgetView.</p>
