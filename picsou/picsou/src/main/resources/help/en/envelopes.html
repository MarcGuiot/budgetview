<p>
  Envelopes group together transactions that represent the same thing in your budget. For instance, all the
  transactions for the reimbursement of a loan are assigned to a same envelope representing this loan.</p>

<p>
  Some envelopes describe a same transaction that repeats on a regular basis - for instance a subscription
  that repeats every month, or the payments of an insurance that repeat every six months.</p>

<p>
  Other envelopes group together several transactions in the same month - for instance a "Groceries" envelope,
  which groups together all the purchases you make during the month, in several stores.</p>

<p>
  Thanks to these envelopes, BudgetView can anticipate the evolution of your budget and the position of your
  bank accounts in the upcoming months.</p>


<h2>Recurrence</h2>

<p>By default, all the envelopes defined in BudgetView are supposed to repeat every month with the same amount.
  You can change that and define envelopes which repeat every two, three or six months, or even every year. You can also define
  envelopes that are used a few months in the year, using a "custom" pattern.</p>

<p>You can also define "irregular" envelopes. In this mode, the amount will not be propagated from one
  month to the next.</p>
