Transparent Persistence, Fault-Tolerance and Load-Balancing for 
Java Business Objects.<br><br><br>

Orders of magnitude <b>FASTER</b> and <b>SIMPLER</b> than a traditional 
DBMS. No pre or post-processing required, no wierd proprietary VM 
required, no base-class inheritance or clumsy interface implementation 
required: just <b>PLAIN JAVA CODE</b>.<br><br><br>

<B><I><P>How is it possible?</P></I></B>
<P>RAM is getting cheaper every day. Researchers are 
announcing major breakthroughs in memory technology. Even today, 
servers with multi-gigabyte RAM are commonplace. For many systems, it is 
already feasible to keep all business objects in RAM.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Do you mean I can simply have my objects in RAM and forget all that database hassle?</P></I></B>
<P>That's right.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Are you crazy? What if there's a system crash?</P></I></B>
<P>To avoid losing data, every night your system server saves a 
snapshot of all business objects to a file using plain object 
serialization.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>What about the changes occurred since the last snapshot was 
taken? Won't the system lose those in a crash?</P></I></B>
<P>No.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>How come?</P></I></B>
<P>All commands received from the system's clients are converted into serializable objects by the server. Before being applied to the business objects, each command is serialized and written to a log file. During crash recovery, first, the system retrieves its last saved state from the snapshot file. Then, it reads the commands from the log files created since the snapshot was taken. These commands are simply applied to the business objects exactly as if they had just come from the system's clients. The system is then back in the state it was just before the crash and is ready to run.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Does that mean my business objects have to be deterministic?</P></I></B>
<P>Yes. They must always produce the same state given the same commands.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Doesn't the system have to stop or enter read-only mode in order to produce a consistent snapshot?</P></I></B>
<P>No. That is a fundamental problem with transparent or orthogonal 
persistence projects like PJama (http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/pjava/) but 
it can be solved simply by having all system commands queued and routed 
through a single place. This enables the system to have a replica of 
the business logic on another virtual machine. All commands applied to 
the "hot" system are also read by the replica and applied in the exact 
same order. At backup time, the replica stops reading the commands and 
its snapshot is safely taken. After that, the replica continues reading 
the command queue and gets back in sync with the "hot" system.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Doesn't that replica give me fault-tolerance as a bonus?</P></I></B>
<P>Yes it does. I have 
mentioned one but you can have several replicas. If the "hot" system 
crashes, any other replica can be elected and take over. Of course, you 
must be able to afford a machine for every replica you want.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Does this whole scheme have a name?</P></I></B>
<P>Yes. It is called system 
prevalence. It encompasses transparent persistence, fault-tolerance and 
load-balancing.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>If all my objects stay in RAM, will I be able to use SQL-based tools to query my objects' attributes?</P></I></B>
<P>No. You will be able to use 
object-based tools. The good news is you will no longer be breaking 
your objects' encapsulation.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>What about transactions? Don't I need transactions?</P></I></B>
<P>Yes, you do. The prevalent design 
gives you all transactional properties without the need for explicit 
transaction semantics in your code.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>How is that?</P></I></B>
<P>DBMSs tend to support only 
a few basic operations: INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE, for example. Because 
of this limitation, you must use transaction semantics (begin - commit) 
to delimit the operations in every business transaction for the benefit 
of your DBMS. In the prevalent design, every transaction is represented 
as a serializable object which is atomically written to the queue (a 
simple log file) and processed by the system. An object, or object 
graph, is enough to encapsulate the complexity of any business 
transaction.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>What about business rules involving dates and time? Won't all those replicas get out of sync?</P></I></B>
<P>No. If you ask the use-case 
gurus, they will tell you: "The clock is an external actor to the 
system.". This means that clock ticks are commands to the business 
objects and are sequentially applied to all replicas, just like all 
other commands.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Is object prevalence faster than using a database?</P></I></B>
<P>The objects are always in 
RAM, already in their native form. No disk access or data marshalling 
is required. No persistence hooks placed by preprocessors or 
postprocessors are required in your code. No "isDirty" flag. No 
restrictions. You can use whatever algorithms and data-structures your 
language can support. Things don't get much faster than that.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Besides being deterministic and serializable, what are the coding standards or restrictions my business classes have to obey?</P></I></B>
<P>None whatsoever. To issue 
commands to your business objects, though, each command must be 
represented as a serializable object. Typically, you will have one 
class for each use-case in your system.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>How scalable is object prevalence?</P></I></B>
<P>The persistence processes 
run completely in parallel with the business logic. While one command 
is being processed by the system, the next one is already being written 
to the log. Multiple log files can be used to increase throughput. The 
periodic writing of the snapshot file by the replica does not disturb 
the "hot" system in the slightest. Of course, tests must be carried out 
to determine the actual scalability of any given implementation but, in 
most cases, overall system scalability is bound by the scalability of 
the business classes themselves.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Can't I use all those replicas to speed things up?</P></I></B>
<P>All replicas have to 
process all commands issued to the system. There is no great 
performance gain, therefore, in adding replicas to command-intensive 
systems. In query-intensive systems such as most Web applications, on 
the other hand, every new replica will boost the system because queries 
are transparently balanced between all available replicas. To enable 
that, though, just like your commands, each query to your business 
logic must also be represented as a serializable object.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Isn't representing every system query as a serializable object a real pain?</P></I></B>
<P>That's only necessary if 
you want transparent load-balancing, mind you. Besides, the queries for 
most distributed applications arrive in a serializable form anyway. 
Take Web applications for example: aren't HTTP request strings 
serializable already?</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Does prevalence only work in Java?</P></I></B>
<P>No. You can use any 
language for which you are able to find or build a serialization 
mechanism. In languages where you can directly access the system's 
memory and if the business objects are held in a specific memory 
segment, you can also write that segment out to the snapshot file 
instead of using serialization.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Is there a Java implementation I can use?</P></I></B>
<P>Yes. You will find 
Prevayler - The Open-Source Prevalence Layer, an example application 
and more information at <A HREF="http://www.prevayler.org">www.prevayler.org</A>. It does not yet 
implement automatic load-balancing but it does implement transparent 
business object persistence and replication is in the oven.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Is Prevayler reliable?</P></I></B>
<P>Prevayler's robustness 
comes from its anticlimactic simplicity. It is orders of magnitude simpler than the 
simplest RDBMS. Although I wouldn't use Prevayler to control a nuclear 
plant just yet, its open-source license ensures the whole of the 
software developing community the ability to scrutinize, optimize and 
extend Prevayler. The real questions you should bear in mind are: "How 
robust is my Java Virtual Machine?" and "How robust is my own code?". 
Remember: you will no longer be writing feeble client code. You will 
now have the means to actually write server code. It is the way object 
orientation was intended all along; but it is certainly not for 
wimps.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>You said Prevayler is open-source software. Do you mean it's free?</P></I></B>
<P>That's right. It is licensed under the BSD License.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>Who is already using Prevayler?</P></I></B>
<P><A HREF="http://www.prevayler.org/wiki.jsp?topic=PrevaylerPioneers">Come and see</A>. Speak your mind.</P><BR><BR>

<B><I><P>But what if I'm emotionally attached to my database?</P></I></B>
<P>For many applications, 
prevalence is a much faster, much cheaper and much simpler way of 
preserving your objects for future generations. Of course, there will 
be all sorts of excuses to hang on to "ye olde database", but at least 
now there is an option.</P><BR><BR>
