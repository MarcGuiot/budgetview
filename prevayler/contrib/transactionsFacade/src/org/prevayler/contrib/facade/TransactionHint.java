/**
 * A TransactionHint contains hints of other things to do inside the
 * transaction.  For instance, set a timestamp or call some specified
 * method from within the Prevayler transaction.  Basically, this allows
 * for a generic way to specify actions internal to the Prevayler
 * transaction, with full knowledge of being within the context of the
 * Prevayler transaction, all without hardcoding anything in the generic
 * proxy transactions.  Methods that are transactionally proxied don't
 * (and shouldn't) really realize they are part of a transaction so they
 * can't take advantage of certain contextual info such as the
 * Prevayler-managed Date object that is passed to each transaction.
 * This class provides access to that context.
 *
 * <p>Currently there exists only a preExecute() method which executes
 * immediately before the transactionally proxied method is invoked.
 * It might be legitimate to add a postExecute() method, but I haven't
 * found the need for it yet, so I didn't add it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Caveat:</h3>
 * <p>Could make for non-deterministic behavior if each time
 * the app is started, it has a different transaction hint
 * defined;  maybe one set of transactions gets timestamped,
 * but then another set doesn't.  Is this acceptable?</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Answer:</h3>
 * <p>Well, the same could be said of hard coded transactions.  Transactions
 * could be modified internally, recompiled, and re-run without
 * the application knowing the difference.  The only difference
 * here is the externalization of the issue to a method separate
 * from the transactionally proxied method itself.
 * Might not be a real issue?</p>
