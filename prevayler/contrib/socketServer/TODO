Important Features
------------------

- Examples

Ideally both Swing and SWT examples should be provided.


- Transparant failover from Prevayler 2.0.

This should be implemented in such a way that it gracefully
falls back to Prevayler 1.0 behavior if failover is not desired.



Features not yet supported (but that would be cool to support)
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Transparant prevalent web services

Serialize the Prevayler Transaction objects and their return
values to XML documents and use an HTTP and/or HTTPS server 
for the socket server transport.  This would make it trivial
to expose prevalent objects as web services callable from 
anything that can send XML over HTTP.  You could then call
Prevayler objects written in Java from Perl or even <gasp/>
Visual Basic if you wanted (or needed) to.


- A SOAP layer for the above

This isn't technically necessary, but would probably make 
Prevayler an easier sell for the server-side of a Visual Basic
or C# client/server application.

Of course all standard web services caveats apply to the last
two choices here: you're trading speed for interoperability.


- Document the standard XML serialization format so that other
prevalent clients and servers can support the same standard.  
Then you could interchange client and server languages at 
will.  ;-)
