    <section name="SAXStack overview">
      <p>SaxStack is a Java library designed to help programmers make a simple and efficient use of XML SAX parsers,
        and also to help them generate XML streams.</p>
      <p>Its main design driver is the modelling of the parsing/generation as a stack of XML node handlers,
        which let the programmers focus on one XML node at a time and end up with an clean and
        efficient design.</p>
