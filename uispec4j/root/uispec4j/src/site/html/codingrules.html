<h1>Coding rules</h1>
<p>We ask you to follow two main rules when working on UISpec4J:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Write unit tests for any single change that you make in the code.</b>
    We already have several hundreds tests in place that will help you understand what kind
    of testing we expect.</li>
  <li><b>Use the naming and formatting rules applied on the current code.</b> We want all the
    source code to look as if it was written by a single individual.</li>
</ul>
