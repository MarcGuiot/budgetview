<p>UISpec4J is an
  open source functional and/or unit-testing Java library for
  Swing-based Java applications that is focused on simplicity.
  UISpec4J's APIs are designed to hide, as much as possible, the
  complexity of Swing, resulting in easy-to-write and easy-to-read
  test scripts.</p>
<h3 id="gui-testing">GUI Testing</h3>
<p>With the advent of Agile development processes such
  as Extreme Programming (XP), automated testing is
  being adopted by an increasingly larger number of development
  teams. There is, however, one area of software that has always had a
  reputation for being difficult to test: graphical user
  interfaces.</p>
<p>In this article, we explain how we faced the same problem on an
  XP project and came up with a solution by building our own GUI
  testing toolkit, which is now available as a free open source
  product. But before delving into this, let's start from the
  beginning: how can we test GUIs?</p>

<h3 id="using-event-driven-robots">Using Event-Driven Robots</h3>
<p>When it comes to setting up automated tests for graphical user
  interfaces, the conventional approach is to use event-driven robots
  that record human interactions with the interface and can replay
  these interactions at will. The interesting part of this approach
  is that it is very simple to create new tests - you don't need a
  developer or someone with scripting skills to do this.</p>
<p>The trouble is, this simplicity comes with a number of
  down sides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You need to have the interface to record the
      tests</strong>. You thus cannot use the tests as a guide for
      driving the development, and you make your development cycles
      longer by preventing developers and testers from working at the
      same time on a given feature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The test suite becomes a burden, preventing changes in
      the GUI</strong>. Writing the first twenty tests is easy, but what
      do you do when you have more than a thousand tests? When you want
      to change a given screen in your application, will you be willing
      to chase down the hundreds of impacted tests and record them all
      again?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, using generated scripts is simply not always
  compatible with an incremental, agile approach.</p>

<h3 id="using-test-specific-apis">Using Test-Specific APIs</h3>
<p>A better solution would be to manually code these tests, so that
  they can be written before the interface is available, and use a
  rich programming language allowing the incremental refactoring of a
  test suite that will remain easy to modify. In the Java/Swing
  world, there are several existing libraries for doing this, such as
  <a href="http://abbot.sourceforge.net">Abbot</a>, <a href=
  "http://jfcunit.sourceforge.net/">JFCUnit</a>, <a href=
  "http://www.marathontesting.com/">Marathon</a>, and <a href=
  "http://jemmy.netbeans.org/">Jemmy</a>.</p>

<p>When we were working on a large Java/Swing application several
  years ago, we had a look at these libraries, but in the end we didn't use them because their APIs were too close to
  Swing and resulted
  in tests that looked too "technical."</p>

<h3 id="the-uispec4j-approach">The UISpec4J Approach</h3>
<p>We wanted a library that would nicely fit into our XP
  process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Test-first programming</strong>: For both panel-level
      unit testing and application-level acceptance testing, meaning that
      we would be able to write tests reading like user interactions
      <em>before</em> the GUI was available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Refactoring</strong>: We would use the Java language
      (rather than, say, Python or Ruby) to benefit from the powerful
      refactoring tools available for that language, thus limiting
      duplication in the test suites.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We then resolved to create our own testing library - and
  UISpec4J was born.</p>
<p>Let's now have a look at some UISpec4J code, to see whether
  these goals have been successfully met.</p>

<h3 id="the-address-book-sample-application">The Address Book Sample Application</h3>
<p>We obviously can't claim to have the most original sample
  application on the planet, but be that as it may, the application
  we will be using here is a simple address book that manages a
  collection of contacts sorted by categories. Figure 1 shows the GUI
  of this application.</p>
<p>The address book GUI is split into three main areas of
  interest:</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the left-hand side, a table displays a list of contacts with
    basic details. The user can add a new entry in the table by
    clicking on the button labeled ... "New contact." How
    intuitive!</li>
  <li>On the right-hand side, a tree shows available categories for
    filtering contacts. A "New category" button is placed on top of the
    tree for creating categories.</li>
  <li>At the bottom of the frame, a form details the currently
    selected contact. The form is composed of labels and editable text
    fields.</li>
</ol>
<p>[img_assist|nid=20|title=|desc=|link=none|align=center|width=661|height=523]<br/>
  <i>Figure 1. Address Book screen</i></p>
<p>A list of possible interactions with the address book could
  be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a new contact.</li>
  <li>Switching between contacts.</li>
  <li>Editing an existing contact.</li>
  <li>Filtering contacts by category.</li>
</ul>
<p>But before playing with the components, we need to set up a test
  class and catch our application.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-test-class">Creating a Test Class</h3>
<p>A typical way to create a UISpec4J test is to create a class
  extending <code>UISpecTestCase</code>, which is itself a subclass
  of <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>'s
  <code>TestCase</code>.</p>

<div class="code"><pre>public class AddressBookTest extends UISpecTestCase {
  ...
}</pre>
</div>

<p>We then tell this class that it needs to run the address book
  application using the <code>main()</code> found in the
  <code>AddressBook</code> class, and that it can run this
  application with no arguments. To do this, we set up an "adapter"
  (<code>UISpecAdapter</code>), whose role is to implement the
  adaptation between the tests suite and the application. In most
  cases, we just use the <code>MainClassAdapter</code> provided with
  the library:</p>
<pre>
<div class="code">public class AddressBookTest extends UISpecTestCase {
  protected void setUp() throws Exception {
    setAdapter(new MainClassAdapter(Main.class, new String[0]));
    }
  ...
}</div>
</pre>

<p>We are now ready to create our first test.</p>

<h3 id="first-test-creating-a-contact">First Test: Creating a Contact</h3>
<p>Let's write a test that creates a new contact using the "New
  contact" button and then checks that a new row appears in the
  contacts table.</p>
<p>The <code>UISpecTestCase</code> class proposes a
  <code>getMainWindow()</code> method that uses the
  <code>UISpecAdapter</code> introduced above to return an UISpec4J
  <code>Window</code> object representing the window displayed by the
  application. This <code>Window</code> object can be used to fetch
  individual UI components such as the "New contact" button, the
  contacts table, and the various text fields used for entering
  contact information.</p>
<p>Here is the corresponding test:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>public void testCreatingAContact() throws Exception {
  // 1. Retrieve the components
  Window window = getMainWindow();
  Table table = window.getTable();
  Button newContactButton = window.getButton("New contact");

  // 2. Check that the contacts table is empty and displays
  // the proper column names
  assertTrue(table.getHeader().contentEquals(new String[]{
    "First name", "Last name", "E-mail", "Phone", "Mobile"
  }));
  assertTrue(table.isEmpty());

  // 3. Click on the "New contact" button and check that an
  // empty row is displayed in the contacts table
  newContactButton.click();
  assertTrue(table.contentEquals(new String[][]{
    {"", "", "", "", ""}
  }));
  assertTrue(table.rowIsSelected(0));

  // 4. Change the fields of the created empty contact and check
  // that the contacts table is updated accordingly
  window.getTextBox("first").setText("Homer");
  window.getTextBox("last").setText("Simpson");
  window.getTextBox("email").setText("homer@simpson.com");
  window.getTextBox("phone").setText("01.02.03.04.05");
  window.getTextBox("mobile").setText("06.07.08.09.10");
  assertTrue(table.contentEquals(new String[][]{
    {"Home", "Simpson", "homer@simpson.com", "012345", "242424"}
  }));
}
</pre>
  </div>

<h3 id="finding-components">Finding Components</h3>
<p>As you can see in the first part of the test, we use the <code>window</code>
  object to retrieve the components using specific methods such as
  <code>getTree()</code>, <code>getButton()</code>, etc. For each
  component type, there are various strategies for fetching
  individual components.</p>
<p>If you know that there is only one button in the panel, then
  just ask for it!</p>
<pre>
<div class="code">Button button = panel.getButton();</div>
</pre>
<p>If there are several buttons in the panel, you specify which
  button you want using its displayed label:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>Button button = panel.getButton("New contact");</pre></div>

<p>If there are several buttons with the same displayed label, you
  can distinguish among them using an "inner name" provided in the
  production code by the application developers with the
  <code>JComponent.setName()</code> method. This is, for instance, what
  we do for the text boxes displayed at the bottom of the address
  book window - they all look the same, so we need to rely on
  internal names that we set in the production code: <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>,
  <code>email</code>, etc. For instance:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>TextBox emailBox = panel.getTextBox("email");</pre></div>

<p>If none of these methods can do the job, you can still provide
  your own piece of code for matching components:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>Button button = panel.getButton(new ComponentMatcher(){
  boolean matches(Component component) {
    return component.isEnabled();
  }
});</pre></div>

<p>Note: for I18N purposes, we usually force the default locale to
  <code>Locale.EN</code> in our tests and use English names for
  retrieving components.</p>
<h5 id="using-a-table-component">Using a Table Component</h5>
<p>The <code>Table</code> class provides lots of methods for
  checking and manipulating the underlying <code>JTable</code>
  component. Most of these methods work with two-dimensional arrays
  representing what the end user is expected to see. For
  instance:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>assertTrue(table.contentEquals(new String[][]{
    {"Homer", "Simpson", "homer@simpson.com", "012345", "2424242"},
    {"Bart", "Simpson", "bart@simpson.com", "123456", "34343434"}
}));</pre></div>


<p>Note: the <code>Table.contentEquals()</code> method, as many
  other UISpec4J component methods, return <code>Assertion</code>
  objects instead of Booleans. These <code>Assertion</code> objects
  are used by UISpec4J to implement retry strategies, mostly for the
  case of multithreaded GUIs where there might be slight delays
  between actions performed in the tests and the corresponding
  changes in the UI. This mechanism is completely transparent in the
  tests, provided that you use <code>UISpecTestCase</code>'s
  <code>assertXxx</code> methods, or those of the
  <code>UISpecAssert</code> class.</p>

<h3 id="second-test-dealing-with-the-categories-tree">Second Test: Dealing with the Categories Tree</h3>
<p>Let's now move to a more complicated test: "a contact must
  belong to the category in which it was created." Additionally, selecting
  a category in the tree should trigger the filtering of the contact
  list.</p>
<p>Here is the code for this test:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>public void testContactsBelongToTheirOriginatedCategories()
  throws Exception {
  // 1. Create the categories structure and check the display
  createCategory("", "friends");
  createCategory("", "work");
  createCategory("work", "design-up");
  assertTrue(window.getTree().contentEquals("All\n" +
    " friends\n" +
    " work\n" +
    " design-up"));

  // 2. Create some entries in the "friends" category
  window.getTree().select("friends");
  window.getButton("New contact").click();
  window.getTextBox("first").setText("Homer");
  window.getTextBox("last").setText("Simpson");
  window.getButton("New contact").click();
  window.getTextBox("first").setText("Marge");
  window.getTextBox("last").setText("Simpson");

  // 3. Create some entries in the "work/design-up" category
  window.getTree().select("work/design-up");
  window.getButton("New contact").click();
  window.getTextBox("first").setText("Regis");
  window.getTextBox("last").setText("Medina");
  window.getButton("New contact").click();
  window.getTextBox("first").setText("Pascal");
  window.getTextBox("last").setText("Pratmarty");

  // 4. Check the contents of the root category (category "All")
  window.getTree().selectRoot();
  assertTrue(window.getTable().contentEquals(new String[][]{
    {"Homer", "Simpson", "", "", ""},
    {"Marge", "Simpson", "", "", ""},
    {"Regis", "Medina", "", "", ""},
    {"Pascal", "Pratmarty", "", "", ""},
  }));

  // 5. Check the contents of the "friends" category
  window.getTree().select("friends");
  assertTrue(window.getTable().contentEquals(new String[][]{
    {"Homer", "Simpson", "", "", ""},
    {"Marge", "Simpson", "", "", ""},
  }));

  // 6. Check the contents of the "work" category
  window.getTree().select("work");
  assertTrue(window.getTable().contentEquals(new String[][]{
    {"Regis", "Medina", "", "", ""},
    {"Pascal", "Pratmarty", "", "", ""},
  }));
}</pre></div>


<p>Steps 1 to 3 set up the initial environment and steps 4 to 6
  check the contacts displayed for each category. For the setup part,
  we use a <code>createCategory()</code> method that is described in
  the next section. On our own projects, we usually end up creating a
  lot of utility methods like this one, and extract a kind of
  functional language for manipulating the GUI.</p>

<h3 id="working-with-dialogs">Working with Dialogs</h3>
<p>The code of the <code>createCategory()</code> method is shown
  below. We first click on the "New category" button, and then
  intercept a modal dialog that pops up for querying the name of the
  category to create.</p>

<div class="code"><pre>protected void createCategory(String parentCategoryPath, String categoryName) {
  window.getTree().select(parentCategoryPath);
  WindowInterceptor.init(window.getButton("New Category").triggerClick())
  .process(new WindowHandler() {
    Trigger process(Window dialog) {
      assertTrue(dialog.titleEquals("Category name:"));
      dialog.getInputTextBox().setText(categoryName);
      return dialog.getButton("OK").triggerClick();
    }
  })
  .run();
}</pre> </div>

<p>This method uses the <code>WindowInterceptor</code> utility
  class to catch the popped-up modal dialog. This is the main class
  of UISpec4J's window interception mechanism, and provides a means
  for working with windows without requiring the user interface to be
  showing on the screen and without requiring any change in the
  production code.</p>
<p>Here is how this works:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code>init()</code></strong>: We first initialize the
      interceptor with what we call a "trigger." A <code>Trigger</code>
      is a piece of code that causes a dialog to be shown by the
      application - for instance, an Open button that displays a file
      chooser, or a Delete button that displays a confirmation window.
      Many UISpec4J components offer ready-to-use components through
      <code>triggerXXX()</code> methods, but you can also provide your
      own implementation of the <code>Trigger</code> interface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code>process()</code></strong>: The window displayed by
      the trigger is caught and given to a <code>WindowHandler</code>
      interface. We provide a <code>WindowHandler</code> implementation
      that first checks that the displayed window's title is "Category
      name", then enters the value of the <code>categoryName</code>
      variable into the displayed text field, and then closes the window
      using its OK button.</p>
    <p>Implementing interceptions like this can look cumbersome, and
      one would like to be able to test the displayed window without
      having to create inner classes. But in the case of modal dialogs
      there is no choice: the application is waiting for the dialog to be
      closed, which means that the main thread of the application is
      blocked, so you need to process the dialog within a new thread. One
      of the strengths of the interception mechanisms is that they hide
      the multithreading issues associated with the management of modal
      dialogs.</p>
    <p>Should you need to intercept non-modal dialogs, however, things
      are much simpler. You would retrieve the window from within
      the test with a single statement; for instance:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>Window window = WindowInterceptor.run(window.getButton("Show").triggerClick());
  window.getTable() ...
  window.getButton() ...</pre></div>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code>run</code></strong>: This is when the whole
      interception gets really executed. The trigger is run, and the
      displayed window is processed by the handler. The
      <code>run()</code> method will throw an exception if no window is
      shown or if the displayed modal dialog is never closed by the
      handler.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note here that the UISpec4J toolkit is
  ultimately responsible for handling the display of every window: if
  the application tries to show a dialog box or a window from outside a
  <code>WindowInterceptor</code> call, the toolkit will immediately
  raise an exception and make the current test fail.</p>

<h3 id="using-tree-components">Using Tree Components</h3>
<p>The tree content is being checked before filling the "friends"
  and "work/design-up" categories with some contacts. As for tables,
  we also use a "graphical" representation: an indented concatenation
  of the string representations of the tree nodes separated by the
  newline (<code>\n</code>) character. In our case:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>assertTrue(window.getTree().contentEquals(
  "All\n" +
  " friends\n" +
  " work\n" +
  " design-up"));</pre>
</div>

<p>You will also have noticed that tree paths are expressed with
  simple strings, usually the displayed tree node names separated
  with slashes - for instance, <code>work/design-up</code>. This policy can be
  overriden quite easily when using UISpec4J's <code>Tree</code>
  component.</p>

<h3 id="other-uispec4j-features">Other UISpec4J Features</h3>
<p>UISpec4J provides other interesting features that we will only
  present briefly here.</p>

<h3 id="using-displayed-values-instead-of-internal-ones">Using Displayed Values Instead of Internal Ones</h3>
<p>UISpec4J uses the values <em>displayed</em> by the components.
  For complex components such as <code>JList</code>,
  <code>JTable</code>, or <code>JTree</code>, this means relying on
  renderers, not just the internal model of the component. For most
  cases, these renderers use <code>JLabel</code> components, so
  UISpec4J will simply retrieve these labels and check their
  displayed text. In more advanced cases, you can easily customize
  how <code>String</code> values are to be interpreted for a specific
  complex component.</p>

<h3 id="extending-uispec4j-to-handle-new-kinds-of-components">Extending UISpec4J to Handle New Kinds of Components</h3>
<p>Even though the UISpec4J API is rich enough to handle most of
  the situations we have had to deal with, there will always be new
  situations to take into account. For instance, many projects will
  want to use UISpec4J with custom-made UI components for which there
  is no UISpec4J wrapper - for instance, a <code>Table</code> with advanced
  sorting and filtering capabilities, or a <code>Calendar</code>
  component, or any custom component coming along with third-party
  libraries (e.g. JavaHelp).</p>
<p>UISpec4J provides an extension mechanism that allows you to
  implement your own UISpec4J component wrappers, and plug them into
  the library by enhancing the <code>Panel</code> class so that it can be used to
  find them in containers as for any other UISpec4J component.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This article presents only an overview of UISpe4J's philosophy
  and capabilities. This framework aims to ease the automated testing
  of Swing-based applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A large toolset allows for writing clear test scripts with little
    effort.</li>
  <li>Advanced users can extend this toolset for manipulating third-party components and checking rendered content in
    more detail.</li>
