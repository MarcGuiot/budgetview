  <p>Using the Java Color class for specifying colors can be too tedious for testing purposes.
    When writing a test that checks that a given table cell is red, we do not always want to
    specify the exact color (#FF0000 in RGB), we just want to say "red" and have our test run
    even if the color chosen by the developers is #DD1111.</p>
  <p>To this end, UISpec4J proposes three different means for checking a color:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use a "user-friendly" color name</strong> such as "red" or "blue". In this case
      the tool will check that the color is a shade of red or blue.
      The authorized names are those of the predefined Color objects defined in the Java
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html">Color</a> class.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a specific color value</strong> such as "FF0021". In this case the tool will check the
      exact color.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a Color object</strong> such as Color.red or a custom made Color. This is especially
      useful in Unit tests, when we want to use a static Color instance used both by the
      production code and the test. In this case the tool will also check the exact color.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is why all color-related methods such as Table.backgroundEquals use Object
    arguments - you can provide them either String or Color objects.</p>
  <p>Behind the scenes, UISpec4J basically computes a distance between expected and actual colors
    by converting them in the HSB (Hue/Saturation/Brightness) color space. Results may not always
    be accurate since colors can be subject to one's judgement, but in such cases you can always
    stick to more formal definitions - although as a result your tests will be more sensible to
    little cosmetic changes.</p>
