      <p>We warmly welcome any help, especially from developers with some knowledge in Java/Swing and
        some experience in test-driven development.</p>
      <p>
        The first thing you can do to help us is to use UISpec4J on you own projects and report
        evolution requests through our
        <a href="https://uispec4j.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">issue tracking system</a>.
        Then, if you want to contribute to the coding effort, simply help us process the issues!
