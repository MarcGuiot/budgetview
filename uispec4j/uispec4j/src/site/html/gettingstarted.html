<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>UISpec4J provides three different sets of components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A set of GUI component wrappers (Trees, Tables, CheckBoxes, etc.)</li>
  <li>A mechanism for intercepting dialogs and pop-ups displayed by the application</li>
  <li>An UISpecTestCase class which extends JUnit's TestCase (this one is optional -
    you can use UISpec4J within your own test cases)</li>
</ul>
There are two main usages for UISpec4J: writing unit tests for individual panels and
dialogs, or writing functional/acceptance tests for the whole application.


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
  In this documentation, we suppose that you already have some experience with JUnit. If that is not
  the case, we invite you to learn more about JUnit on its website:
  <a href="http://www.junit.org">http://www.junit.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
  To use UISpec4J, you will need a Java Development Kit version 1.4.2 or later.
</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
  UISpec4J runs in the same JVM as your application (or at least the client application if you
  are testing a distributed system). In order to run the tests, you will need to add uispec4j-xxx.jar
  to your classpath, along with its dependencies. You can download or find these JARs
  from our <a href="/download">downloads</a> page.
</p>


<h2>Initializing UISpec4J</h2>
<p>
  In order for UISpec4J to be fully operational, you will need to call the
  <a href="/reports/apidocs/org/uispec4j/UISpec4J.html#init()">UISpec4J.init()</a> method before doing anything
  with Swing (please refer to the <a href="interception.html">interception</a> documentation
  for further details).
</p>
<p>
  For your first test case, you can just call that method from the static initializer of
  your test class:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
public class MyOwnTest extends TestCase {
  static {
      UISpec4J.init();
  }

  public void testSomething() {
    ...perform your tests here...
  }
  ...
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  Please note that having UISpec4J run on Linux may require some adjustements - please refer to our
  <a href="troubleshooting.html">troubleshouting</a> page for further details.
</p>


<h2>Writing unit tests</h2>
<p>In most cases, you will have classes that represent panels in the user interface. These
  classes will typically extend or create a JPanel containing the Swing components
  to be displayed:
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
public class MyOwnPanel extends JPanel {
  ... provide your own panel contents and behaviour ...
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>All you need to do for unit-testing such a class is to stick the JPanel into an UISpec4J
  <a href="/reports/apidocs/org/uispec4j/Panel.html">Panel</a>
  wrapper, and then start retrieving and using individual components:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
public class MyOwnPanelTest extends TestCase {
  public void testInitialState() {
    ... setup the context needed to instanciate MyOwnPanel ...
    Panel panel = new Panel(new MyOwnPanel(...));
    panel.getTable().contentEquals(...);
    ...
    panel.getButton("Apply").click();
    ...
    }
  }
...
</pre>
</div>


<h2>Writing functional tests</h2>
<p>
  In the case of functional tests, we do not want to test individual GUI classes, we want to access
  the application as a whole. To support this, we propose a specific TestCase class - UISpecTestCase -
  which offers the following interface:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
public void UISpecTestCase extends TestCase {
  public Window getMainWindow();
}
        </pre>
</div>

<p>To write a functional test case, you simply need to subclass UISpecTestCase an start using the
  Window component returned by getMainWindow() to retrieve its individual GUI components:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
public void MyFunctionalTestCase extends UISpecTestCase {
  public void test() {
    Window mainWindow = getMainWindow();
    mainWindow.getMenuBar().getMenu("File").getSubMenu("Open...").click();
    ...
    mainWindow.getTree().contentEquals(...);
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>In an Extreme Programming setting, these tests are written
  <i>before</i>
  the corresponding features
  are made available in the application, and they are written by testers instead of developers.
</p>
<p>To support this, the UISpecTestCase has been designed so that the tests can be implemented
  and compiled without depending on the application. The binding with the application is established
  at runtime, through the UISpecAdapter interface:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
public interface UISpecAdapter {
  Window getMainWindow();
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>This interface is meant to be implemented by developers, who will certainly initialize their
  application and return a Window component wrapping the JFrame instance corresponding to
  the application's main window.
  <br/>
  The UISpecAdapter is then plugged into the tests suite by setting the uispec4j.adapter property:
</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>java -cp ... -Duispec4j.adapter=com.mycomp.MyUISpecAdapter ...</pre>
</div>

<p>The tool will then use Java's reflection mechanism to instanciate the adapter and initialize
  the UISpecTestCase in its setUp() method.</p>
<p>Another way to set up the adapter is to call the
  <a href="/reports/apidocs/org/uispec4j/UISpecTestCase.html">UISpecTestCase.setAdapter()</a>
  method from
  within your test class, for instance in its setUp() method.
</p>
