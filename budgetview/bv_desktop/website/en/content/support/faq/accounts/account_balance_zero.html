    This depends on the means by which you have imported your account statements.</p>

<p> BudgetView manages two key import formats:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>OFX</strong>:
        integrates several accounts, indicates the account numbers and balance of each.
    </li>
    <li><strong>QIF</strong>:
        simply an operations list, without indicating account details or balance.</li>
    <li><strong>CSV</strong>:
        simply an operations list, from which BudgetView cannot get account details or balance.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your bank only offers a QIF or CSV export and no balance information was previously available in the application,
    BudgetView will not show any balance after your first import.</p>

<p>Should this be the case, you will have to click on the account balance in the "Accounts"
    view, then enter the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">last</span> known balance.
    Subsequently, BudgetView will automatically update this balance with successive imports,
    following transactions made.
