            <p>BudgetView is designed and developed by <b>Marc Guiot</b> and <b>Régis Medina</b>.</p>

            <p>We have been working on this project in addition to our daily jobs since 2006.
                Over countless weekends, evenings and vacation days, we have evolved BudgetView from a simple idea
                on a piece of paper to the complete application you can enjoy today:</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Our main goal:</p>

            <p class="centered" style="width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"><b>
                Provide you with the clearest possible view of your budget<br/>
                to help you achieve your most important projects.
            </b></p>

            <p>Of course, there are many competing applications and websites around. We think however that BudgetView brings a unique
                approach to the field, based on three principles:
                :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A visual, high-level representation of your budget rather than a long list of operations.</li>
                <li>A powerful forecast to show you where you are going rather than a bunch of tools to dissect the
                    past.
                </li>
                <li>Personal information that remains at home rather than putting everything on a website.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To date, approximately 500 people use BudgetView regularly. If BudgetView Please help us to spread the
                talking around you!</p>

            <p> Please also <a href="mailto:support@mybudgetview.fr" class="highlighted">contact us</a> to give us your
                impressions and ideas - we are not always able to respond to all messages, but we read them all, and
                really they are the heart of our decisions when we develop the software.
