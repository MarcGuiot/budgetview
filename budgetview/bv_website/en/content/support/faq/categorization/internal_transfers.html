      This situation differs according to whether the accounts in question are current or savings accounts.
    </p>

    <p>For transfers <b>between accounts designated as "current accounts"</b> in BudgetView, we recommend that you create a
      variable "Internal transfers" envelope to which you will assign all relevant operations. These will then balance
      out in pairs, meaning that the expected and real value of the envelope should always be 0.</p>

    <p>For transfers <b>between current accounts and savings accounts</b>,
      <a href="/support/faq/categorization/savings-transfers">visit the dedicated page</a>.
