<p>With BudgetView, no need to enter transations manually: you can download
    them directly from your bank's website, as indicated in this guide.</p>

<p>To download your bank statements, use the "File / Import transactions" menu. This will open
    the import dialog, where you can select your bank. BudgetView will then indicate the most
    appropriate way to download transactions from your bank, among two main options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Direct download from your bank's servers</li>
    <li>Manual file download from your bank's website</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If your bank is not listed, you can select "Other" and then proceed to the
    "<a href="#manual-download">Download from website</a>" instructions.</p>


<h2 id="direct-download">Direct download</h2>

<p>If your bank supports a direct download from its servers, you will be asked to enter
    your login information. BudgetView will then propose the list of accounts to download,
    and then retrieve the corresponding transactions automatically.</p>

<p>Please note that your login information will only be sent to your bank's servers -
    it will not be sent to us, nor even saved on your computer.</p>


<h2 id="manual-download">Downloading an OFX/QIF/CSV file from your bank's website</h2>

<p>Here are the main steps for downloading bank statements manually:</p>

<table class="field-value">
    <tr>
        <td class="field">1</td>
        <td class="value"><p>
            Visit your bank's website with a brower, and login to access your personal account.
        </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="field">2</td>
        <td class="value"><p>
            Find the "downloads" page - you should usually find it near the space where your
            main account transactions are displayed.
        </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="field">3</td>
        <td class="value"><p>
            Select the accounts to download, and the file format: OFX (Microsoft Money), QIF (Intuit Quicken) or
            CSV (Comma-Separated Values) - preferably OFX.
            You can retrieve as many transactions as you want, BudgetView will take care of ignoring duplicate
            transactions and it will also categorize most of your transactions based on the past information available.
        </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="field">4</td>
        <td class="value"><p>
            Start the download.
        </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="field">5</td>
        <td class="value"><p>
            If your browser allows it, use the "Open with..." option and select BudgetView. You can also
            save the file on your Windows desktop, and then double click on it to open it in BudgetView.
        </p></td>
    </tr>
</table>
